Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil. 
Beth
And I’m Beth. 
Neil
Would you like some fried chicken and chips with gravy, Beth? 
Beth
No thanks, Neil. I don’t really like fried chicken. It’s too oily for me. 
Neil
Okay, no problem. But, maybe you’d like some organic poulet roti in a tender meat
jus with frites? 
Beth
Ooh! Now, that sounds interesting. What is it? 
Neil
Well, it’s French for… chicken and chips with gravy! It’s a strange fact but the same
dish described using different words can make it sound more delicious, more
exotic and more desirable.    6 Minute English ©British Broadcasting Corporation 2024

Restaurants think carefully about the language they use to describe the food on
their menus, trying to make it sound appealing, tasty or poetic. Instead of
hamburgers, we have ‘gourmet burgers’, it’s ‘jus’ not gravy, and raspberry ‘coulis’
sounds a lot tastier than raspberry sauce. 
Neil
Many of the words used to describe gourmet food - that’s food which is higher-
quality and more sophisticated than usual - are French, coming from a country
with a long tradition of high-level cooking called haute cuisine. 
Beth
But how does the language used to describe food affect our psychology, and help
restaurants make menus which are both tempting and profitable? That’s what
we’ll be finding out in this programme, along with some useful new vocabulary as
well. But first I have a question for you, Neil. To train as a classical French chef
takes months as a full-time apprentice, but what is the name of the most famous
cooking school teaching French haute cuisine? Is it: 
a) Le Cordon Bleu?
b) Le Cordon Rouge? or,
c) Le Cordon Noir? 
Neil
Well, I think it’s le Cordon Bleu. 
Beth
OK, Neil, I’ll reveal the correct answer later. It’s important for restaurants to
describe items on the menu so diners know what to expect, and many chefs think
foreign words sound more exciting. But according to linguist, Dr Keri Matwick, the
use of French is decreasing. Here, Keri explains why to Ruth Alexander, presenter
of BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain: 
Dr Keri Matwick
Yeah, there are studies that show that because it sounds fancier, you know,
therefore… French food has long been considered the gourmet food, and it was   6 Minute English ©British Broadcasting Corporation 2024

popular. But I would say in now there's a tendency to not use French because it
sounds pretentious. 
Ruth Alexander
So it can turn a diner off. 
Neil
Many restaurants use French names in menus because they sound fancy, an
adjective meaning special or unusual, with lots of decoration. Keri disagrees. She
thinks French names used to be popular but are now seen as pretentious. If
something is pretentious, it tries to appear more important or clever than it really
is. 
Beth
Some diners like the French names, but it turns other diners off. If something turns
you off, it makes you stop feeling interested or excited. 
Neil
Brazilian chef Caroline Martins agrees that using French names in menus is
becoming a thing of the past. Caroline has stopped using French names in her pop-
up restaurant, Sampa, in Manchester, as she explained to Ruth Alexander, for BBC
World Service programme The Food Chain: 
Caroline Martins 
I am classically trained in French cuisine. I was using a lot of French terms, you
know, and that wasn't very welcome. People would be very confused, they would
ask me, ‘Oh, what is this brunoise? What is this chiffonade?’ They would definitely
avoid the dishes, or they would be sarcastic as well about it, you know. I had people
booking a table, sitting down, and then they start seeing all these French terms,
and they just leave. Yes, yes, I had that happening. 
Ruth Alexander
You had people walking out of the restaurant? They just think, ‘This isn't for me!’.    6 Minute English ©British Broadcasting Corporation 2024

Caroline Martins
‘This isn't for me!…What is this…?’ You know, ‘What am I eating? I wanna eat food,
I don't wanna eat names, posh names, you know.’ 
Beth
Instead of feeling excited about dishes described in French, Caroline’s diners were
sarcastic about them, they mocked and made fun of them. Some diners even
walked out! 
Neil
Caroline thinks French makes her cooking sound too posh, too fashionable,
expensive and not available to everyone. She has now started using English and
her native Brazilian Portuguese on the menu and is pleased with the results –
customers don’t feel confused, and their curiosity about the Brazilian dishes starts
a conversation with the waiter. 
Beth
Hmm, all this talk of food is making me hungry, Neil. Anyway, it’s time to reveal
the answer to my question. What’s the name of the famous French cooking school
that teaches haute cuisine? 
Neil
I said it was Le Cordon Bleu. Was I right? 
Beth
Le Cordon Bleu was… the correct answer! The famous culinary arts school, Le
Cordon Bleu, first opened its doors in Paris is 1895. OK, let's recap the vocabulary
we've learned from this programme, starting with gourmet food, food which is
better quality and more sophisticated than usual, and is often more expensive. 
Neil
The adjective, fancy, means special, unusual, and decorative. 
Beth
If someone is pretentious, they try to appear more important or clever than they
really are.   6 Minute English ©British Broadcasting Corporation 2024

Neil
The phrase, to turn someone off, means to make someone stop feeling interested
or excited. 
Beth
If you say something sarcastic, you mock and insult something by saying the
opposite of what you mean. 
Neil
And finally, the adjective posh means fashionable, smart, expensive and exclusive.
